you can change way display half image pizza:
+ Left half pizza: split right image with intrinsic size (width=width/2:width), after display in right <div class="half-pizza-container"> with max-height:250px
+ Right half pizza: split left image with intrinsic size (width=0:width/2), after display in left <div class="half-pizza-container"> with max-height:250px

you cropped images OK, but display wrong 
+ first <div class="half-pizza-container"> is panel left I need image cropped display right
+ second <div class="half-pizza-container"> is panel right I need image cropped display left
