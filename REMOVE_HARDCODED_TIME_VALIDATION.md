# Remove Hardcoded Time Validation

## ✅ Update Complete!

Removed hardcoded time validation (`min="17:00" max="21:45"`) from the time input field since we now use dynamic `wpsl_reservation_hours` from the database.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before:
```html
<input type="time" name="start_time" id="start_time" required min="17:00" max="21:45">
<small>Operating hours: 5:00 PM – 9:45 PM</small>
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Hardcoded time restriction (5:00 PM - 9:45 PM)
- ❌ Doesn't match actual store hours from database
- ❌ All stores forced to same hours
- ❌ Browser shows error: "Value must be 5:00 PM or later"

### After:
```html
<input type="time" name="start_time" id="start_time" required>
<small>Operating hours vary by store - select date & time to see available branches</small>
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No hardcoded time restrictions
- ✅ Users can select any time
- ✅ Validation happens server-side against `wpsl_reservation_hours`
- ✅ Each store can have different hours
- ✅ More flexible and accurate

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Step 1: User Selects Any Time
- ✅ User can pick any time (e.g., 9:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 11:00 PM)
- ✅ No browser validation error
- ✅ Time input accepts all values

### Step 2: System Checks Store Hours
When user selects date + time:

```php
// Check wpsl_reservation_hours for each store
$reservation_hours = get_post_meta($store_id, 'wpsl_reservation_hours', true);

// Example hours from database:
array(
    'monday' => array('9:00 AM,5:00 PM'),      // Store A: 9 AM - 5 PM
    'tuesday' => array('6:00 PM,11:00 PM'),    // Store A: 6 PM - 11 PM
    // ...
)
```

### Step 3: Show Only Available Stores
- ✅ Store A (9 AM - 5 PM): Shows if time is between 9 AM - 5 PM
- ✅ Store B (6 PM - 11 PM): Shows if time is between 6 PM - 11 PM
- ✅ Store C (Closed): Hidden for that day

### Step 4: No Stores Available
If user selects time when no stores are open:
```
"No branch can make reservation as per your given time: 01/11/2025 03:00"
```

    'saturday' => array('11:00 AM,11:00 PM'),  // Brunch + dinner
